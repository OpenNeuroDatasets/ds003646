This dataset is composed of multi-sex, multi-age, multi-strain cohorts including 13 male Long-Evans, 22 male Wistar,  11 female Wister, 21 male Sprague-Dawley, and 11 female Sprague-Dawley rats, acquired at Center for Animal MRI (CAMRI) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Chapel Hill, NC, USA). The rats were anesthetized with 0.05mg/kg/hour of dexmedetomidine with 0.5% isoflurane. Pancuronium Bromide 0.5 mg/kg/hour was used for mechanical ventilation. The dataset includes isotropic whole-brain 20 to 30min functional scans with a TR of 2 sec gradient-echo EPI sequence.
